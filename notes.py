# lambda functions = declares anonymous functions
# a function without a name(anonymous)
# use def for lambda just like regular functions...we don't have to give a name
# used for quick and fast not to reference throughout the program
# lambda takeaways:
# single-line function w no name
# any number of arguments
# only ONE expression
#

#
# MACHINE LEARNING
#
# uses algorithms and statistical models to predict outcomes
# similary and the basis for AI
# uses past data to rpedict future
# types:
# Supervised ML: works with labeled data
#####row = sample
#####column = feature
# unsupervised ML: works with unlabeled data
# images are 2D; the color intensity ranges from 0 to 16 which creates the projected image
